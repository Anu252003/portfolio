About Me
As a recent graduate in B.E (computer science and engineering), I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge in data science to drive business growth and solve complex problems. I am eager to learn and take on new challenges in this field.

Projects
1. Neural Networks 
   Steps:
       1. Statistical Analysis: Import libraries, load data, perform EDA, calculate summary stats, visualize distributions.
       2. Create Training/Testing Datasets: Split data into training (~70-80%) and testing sets (~20-30%).
       3. Build/Train Neural Network: Define architecture, compile model, train on training data.
       4. Improve Results: Hyperparameter tuning, try different architectures, ensemble methods, feature engineering.
       5. Results/Metrics: Evaluate final model, calculate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC), visualize results.
      
2. Analysis of COVID-19 lockdown measures
       Objective
            Analyze the relationship between daily COVID-19 cases and lockdown measures in India.
       Dataset
            World Bank dataset of India with 16 columns and 799 rows, including:
    - Daily cases
    - Lockdown measures (school closing, workplace closing, gatherings restrictions, etc.)

      Requirements
         1. Comprehensive EDA
         2. Statistical techniques to find hidden insights
         3. Interpret results with proper reasoning
         4. Submit ipynb file with commented code and outputs

      Deliverables
         1. Multiple critical relationships between daily cases and lockdown measures
         2. In-depth analysis of results with supporting reasoning
         3. Airline Database 
              - Designed and implemented a database schema to store airline data, including flight schedules and passenger information
              - Developed a data warehousing and ETL pipeline using SQL and Python to extract insights from the database
